    <p>Sure, with a little technique, it's not difficult to produce excellent steaks through pan-searing alone. But for flawlessly even edge-to-edge cooking and consistently foolproof results, sous vide is absolutely the better way.</p>
    <p>To achieve a nice crust along with that perfectly cooked meat, finish these sous vide steaks in a pan or on the grill. For information on what temperature settings to use and how long to cook steak sous vide, see the note at the bottom of this recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 sirloin steaks, each about 200g and 2cm thick</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, left whole but bashed once</li>
        <li>sprig of thyme or rosemary <strong>(optional)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the fridge about 30 mins before you plan to cook, so they’re closer to room temperature. Pat the steaks dry with kitchen paper, and season with salt and pepper. Take a heavy-based frying pan that will comfortably fit both steaks, add the oil and heat over a high flame.</li>
        <li>When the oil is shimmering, turn the heat down to medium-high and add the butter. Once it’s sizzling, carefully lay the steaks in the pan, tucking the garlic and herbs in at the sides.</li>
        <li>With a pair of tongs, sear and turn the steaks every 30 secs to 1 min so they get a nice brown crust. As a rough guide, each steak will take 3 mins in total for rare, 4-5 mins in total for medium and 7-8 mins for well done. If you have a digital cooking thermometer, the middle of the steak should be 50C for rare, 60C for medium and 70C for well done.</li>
    </ol>
